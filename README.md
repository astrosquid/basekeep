# basekeep
üè∞ A utility for maintaining your PostgreSQL database through files and tracking its history in version control.

## Purpose
basekeep is intended to make database structure maintainance easy. Databases are difficult to edit consistently because they are not tracked by version control. Therefore, basekeep will make changes to a database by using a file tree as a reference. It is only UNIX compatible, and does not have a Windows port planned (yet).

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** basekeep will destroy things that are no longer represented in the file structure. It is highly recommended to obtain a pg_dump of your entire database before running basekeep against it.

In the future, basekeep will help first-time setup by generating a file tree based on the current state of the database.

Talk to your DBA. If you're not sure, don't.

‚ò¢Ô∏è basekeep **does not** yet give a warning when it destroys objects of any kind (data, columns, tables, schemas, etc).

## Setup
After you've decided on which database you'd like to track, you'll need to make a folder that has the same name as your database. For instance if you had an app with a database called "myappdb", your database folder will also be called "myappdb".

Inside this folder should be a list of important settings ("myappdb.json"), such as users and user permissions (TODO. For now, the only required entry is `"is_basekeep_db": "true"`). The db folder should also contain directories named after schemas. 

Schema folders should include a JSON file with the same name and having the entry `"is_schema": "true"`. They will also contain JSON files describing tables.

Create a user for this database named `basekeep` and grant it all permissions. Give it a password, or else üîÆ.

In the database folder, please add a file called `.secrets.json`. In it, add an entry `"dbpass": BASEKEEP-PASSWORD`. Don't forget to add this file to your `.gitignore`.

TODO: Add password flag to program invokation. 

Usage: `python3 basekeep -l <db-folder>`
